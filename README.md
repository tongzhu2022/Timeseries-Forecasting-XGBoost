# Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the hourly energy usage dataset to identify and remove outliers through visualization
- Applied the `TimeSeriesSplit` cross-validation technique to train the model, thereby addressing the issue of overfitting
- Optimized the model's predictive performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, implemented lag features into the model to further improve its accuracy
